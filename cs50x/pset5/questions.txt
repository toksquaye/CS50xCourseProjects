1. GIF - 8 bits/pixel - 256 different colors
   BMP varies depending on bits/pixel. 1bpp - 2 colors, 2bpp - 4 colors, 4bpp - 16 colors, 8bpp - 256 colors, 16bpp - 65536 colors, 
   24bpp - 16,777.216 colors, 32 bpp - 4,294,967,296 colors
   JPEG - most popular is 24bpp - 16,777,214 colors
   PNG - 24bpp - 16,777,214 colors, 32bpp - 4,294,967,296 colors
 
2. GIF supports animation

3.Lossy compression permits reconstruction only of an approximation of the original.  Lossless compression allows original data to be perfectly 
reconstructed from compressed data.

4. JPEG is lossy compressed.

4.In a FAT system, when a file is deleted, the actual file data is never touched.  The system simply modifies the filename's first character
to denote that the file has been deleted and the directory entry can be recycled.  The system then moves all the file's FAT clusters to the 
hard drive's list of free clusters.

5. I can choose to reboot the PC disk which will fill every addressable block with ASCII null bytes os that the original datat cannot be recovered. Or, 
I can get a free sanitization tool on the internet.

6. stdint.h is the header file that defines sets of integer types with specific widths and their corresponding macros.

7.They specify the exact number of bits being used to represent the different fields in the struct.

8. BYTE - 1byte   DWORD - 4bytes  LONG - 4bytes     WORD - 2bytes

9. 1st 2 bytes identify the BMP file.  Value is BM in ascii.

10. bfsize - size of the BMP file in bytes
    bisize - size of the bitmap info header
    
11. biHeight - if it's negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB. It's origin is the upper-left corner

12. biBitCount specifies bits per pixel

13. It will be NULL if there's no space in the directory for the file to be created.

14.It's always 1 because we're reading one element of data at a time.

15. The padding will be 3.

16. fseek moves the file position indicator to a new location determined by the number of bytes in the 2nd parameter

17 seek_cur is the current postion of the file.
